The aim of the project was to studyt he impact of the lock-down due to COVID-19 pandemic on the 800 MHz frequency layer of an operatorâ€™s LTE network in the city of Milan.
To do that, I had access to Radio Access Network data relatively collected between January 1st and March 31st 2020 (full lock- down in Italy started on 9th March 2020).
The main steps of the study were to Recognise (and differentiate) residential and non-residential network areas through clustering and Study the variation of residential and non-residential network cells performance due to lock down.
Data samples were provided with Hourly granularity with Network Cells Identifiers and ExactLocation regardind 16 Radio Access KPIs of 3 Categories (Accessibility, Mobility and Usage).
